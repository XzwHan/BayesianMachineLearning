## naive_Bayes_classifier.ipynb
Implementation of naive Bayes classifier, with Bernoulli distribution for class label, and Student's t-distribution for class specific predictive distribution (derived from i.i.d. normal likelihood with normal-gamma priors). Achieved 93.27 test accuracy.

## EM_probit.ipynb
Implementation of EM algorithm for the probit regression model, with the assumption of Gaussian prior for weight vector, and obtained maximum a posteriori solution for weight vector as a point estimate after 100 iterations. Applied it in marginal distribution for class label and achieved 93.52% test accuracy.
